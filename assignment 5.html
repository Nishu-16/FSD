    <h3>What is Web Storage?</h3>
    <p>
      <strong>localStorage</strong> and <strong>sessionStorage</strong> are features of Web Storage in HTML5.  
      They allow websites to store data on the user's browser without using cookies.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>localStorage</strong> stores data with no expiration time. It remains even after the browser is closed and reopened.  
      It is useful for saving user preferences or settings.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>sessionStorage</strong> stores data only for the duration of a page session.  
      It is cleared when the browser tab is closed.  
      It's useful for temporary data like form progress.
